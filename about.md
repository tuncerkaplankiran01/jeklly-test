Hey there. I am Ozgur. 

I am software developer living in Ankara Turkey. I mostly work on network and
security related products. I developed the open source project 
[MyDLP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MyDLP) and built a commercial bussines
around it and sold it later with my friends.  

It has been more than a decade since I started professional software 
development and I noticed that I have been always in need to learn new stuff
and also need to remember and relearn things I have done in the past. 

So this I started to this blog to:  

- Note tips, methods, technologies or techniques I encountered or utilised.
- Keep a reference to other sources that are interesting. 
- Occasionally rant about meaning of life, people, politics and other stuff that I do not have a clue about.
